# VMware

Vmware is a hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM) which is a virtualization and cloud computing software provider that offers a range of products for creating, managing, and optimizing virtualized IT environments. 

## Advantages of using a Hypervisor:

- Resource Optimization: Hypervisors allow multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical device.
- Isolation: Each VM operates in its isolated environment improves security and stability, as issues in one VM do not directly impact others.
- Consolidation and Efficiency: By consolidating multiple servers into virtual machines on a single physical server.
- Dynamic Resource Allocation: Hypervisors allow for dynamic allocation of resources, enabling to scale up or down based on workload demands without affecting other VMs on the same host.
- Cost Savings: Using a hypervisor enables organizations to reduce the number of physical servers needed, resulting in cost savings on hardware, power, cooling, and physical space.
- Operating System Independence: Hypervisors abstract the underlying hardware, allowing different operating systems to run on the same physical machine simultaneously.
- VM Migration: VM images can be easily migrated between different machines.
- Snapshot and Cloning: Snapshots allow for the capture of the VM's state at a specific point in time.
- Isolated Testing Environments: Developers can use hypervisors to create isolated testing environments without affecting the actual machine.
